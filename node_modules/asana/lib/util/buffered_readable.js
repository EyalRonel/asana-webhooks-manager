/**
 * Creates a readable stream that contains a buffer in case downstream
 * pushes back. This is useful for streams that are populated by "expensive"
 * requests that return batches of data, because it provides signal (via the
 * `_pushUnbuffered` call) as to whether it is buffering.
 *
 * This is preferable to just piping to some kind of buffering stream,
 * because we want to be aware of whether or not we are buffered downstream,
 * to avoid making requests from upstream until necessary. If we piped to a
 * pure buffering stream it would only make sense for its `push` call to signal
 * whether the buffer was full, which is not helpful for our use case.
 *
 * Instances must override `_readUnbuffered` instead of `_read`, and call
 * `pushBuffered` instead of `push`.
 *
 * @param {Object} options Options for `Readable`.
 * @constructor
